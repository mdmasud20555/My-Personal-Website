            Born and raised in the small yet enchanting South Asian country of Bangladesh. I was born on May 3rd, 2003. I am very proud of being a member of my family.
            <br><br>

            My educational journey started at Dream Kinder Garden in Paragram, setting the stage for my academic path. Progressing through Paragram High School, these early years fueled my thirst for knowledge.
           <br><br>
           
           After completing high school, I delved into college life at Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman College, marking a phase filled with cherished memories, profound lessons, and personal growth. It was here that my passion for learning and exploration truly blossomed.
           <br><br>
           
           Now, I'm actively engaged in the dynamic field of Business Administration at Daejin University, South Korea. Known for my politeness and kindness, I believe in the transformative power of empathy, fostering strong relationships and shaping my life's approach.
           <br><br>
           
           Driven by a relentless motivation for success, I constantly set new goals, pushing my boundaries. Embracing the belief that learning about the world sparks astonishment and inspiration, my curiosity propels me to seek new knowledge and experiences.
